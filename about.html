						Every website has a story of their own. They tell it through their own features and aesthetic design presented to its users. A user who enters the website look through the story of the website and decides whether the story has the potential to add value to them. 
						<br/><br/>
						My goal as a web developer is to bring out the aesthetic design of any website and highlight the features of the website to its users. 
						<br/><br/>
						I have graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Computer Engineering (2012 – 2015). It is through these 3 years in my polytechnic education that I found my love for web developer. What I like about web development is that I feel that it is amazing that having just a simple website it can convey its message and provide values through to its users throughout the world. 
						<br/><br/>
						I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I’m looking to hone my skills as a programmer there and to discover different areas of computing. During my free time, I also look to improve myself as I learn new programming languages and continue to build my own personal projects.
