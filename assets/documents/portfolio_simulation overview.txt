As a trader, I look to be profitable. This websites provides a mathematical model to project the expected returns a year if a trader follows the parameters set up himself. This mathematical model takes the probabilty of winning, breakeven, loosing trades, percentage risk on each trade and the reward to risk ratio to calculate the returns in a year. It shows the monthly returns and also a return after each trade. This helps a trader believe in his own system if he keeps to it.
